모Nowadays, more and more college students are addicted to online games.
 Those games may be funny and exciting, but are very harmful
 to those addicts.

모모In my opinion, there are many disadvantages of game addiction.Firstly,
 online games take up a lot of players몶 time for study. Many of the addicts 
found themselves forced to drop out of school for poor academic performance. 
econdly, addicts tend to isolate themselves from the reality. What몶s worse ,
indulging in the virtual world for a long time, they are more liable to suffer 
mental problem and physical collapse. Thirdly , players are exposed to too much 
iolent and unhealthy material, which is definitely harmful to their growth.

모모In short,I cannot see any benefits from online games.Study should be the 
primary concern of college students. Therefore,I do hope they can step away from 
online games.
